{"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice! What kind of backend service are you thinking about? For example, web APIs, data processing, or something else?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Mostly REST APIs, user authentication, and some background jobs."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it. Common choices include Python (FastAPI, Django), Node.js (Express, NestJS), or Java (Spring Boot). Do you have any language preference?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "I have experience with Python, so probably FastAPI."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "FastAPI is a great choice. It's fast, easy to use, and works well with async tasks and background jobs."}
{"role": "user", "content": "I also want to deploy it on the cloud."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "You can deploy FastAPI on AWS, GCP, or Azure. Common setups use Docker with services like AWS ECS or GCP Cloud Run."}
{"role": "user", "content": "The project might grow to handle more users later."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "In that case, you should consider scalability aspects like load balancing, database choice, and caching (e.g., Redis)."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Is it expensive?"}
